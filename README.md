# yep-bot
A music bot based on the discord.js API v.13  
To run the project:  
  
You need npm and your own discord bot.
  
1. Clone the repository
2. Rename "config.json.template" to "config.json" and fill it in with your own token. Never publish your bot token. 
3. Run "npm install"
4. Run "node index.js" on the command line and the bot will start and show up online.
  
TODO: Lots of cleanup and new commands such as skip, search, pause and play.
